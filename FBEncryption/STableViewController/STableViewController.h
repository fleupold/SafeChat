// dragging ends. 
- (CGFloat) headerRefreshHeight;

// Will be called if the user drags down which will show the header view. Override this to
// update the header view (e.g. change the label to "Pull down to refresh").

// If the user is dragging, will be called on every scroll event that the headerView is shown.

// "refresh" when the user releases the drag.

// Called when the user stops dragging and, if the conditions are met, will trigger a refresh.

// If the value is NO, -refresh should be aborted.
